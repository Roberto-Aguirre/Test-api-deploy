Deploying a Node.js API to a server involves several steps, including setting up the server, installing dependencies, configuring the application for production, and ensuring that the application runs reliably. Below, I'll walk you through the steps to deploy a simple Node.js API to a server, using **Ubuntu** as the environment and **Nginx** as a reverse proxy (optional but recommended).

### Prerequisites
Before proceeding, you need:
- A **Node.js API** (You should have a Node.js API project ready for deployment).
- A **server** running Ubuntu (can be a local machine, a VPS, or cloud instance).
- **SSH access** to your server.
- Basic knowledge of working with **Node.js** and **Linux** command line.

### Step 1: Set Up the Server

1. **Install Node.js and npm** (if not already installed on the server):
   You can follow these instructions if Node.js is not installed:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nodejs npm
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use **NodeSource** to install the latest LTS version of Node.js (this is recommended):

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt install nodejs
   ```

2. **Install Nginx** (optional but recommended for reverse proxy):
   
   Nginx can be used as a reverse proxy to manage requests and provide SSL termination. It will forward traffic to your Node.js application.

   Install Nginx:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nginx
   ```

   After installation, make sure Nginx is running:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start nginx
   sudo systemctl enable nginx
   ```

### Step 2: Transfer Your Node.js API to the Server

To deploy your API, you need to transfer your Node.js application from your local machine to the server. There are several ways to do this:

- **Using SCP (Secure Copy)**: If you're on a local machine, you can use SCP to transfer files.

   Example:

   ```bash
   scp -r /path/to/your/app user@your_server_ip:/path/to/deployment/folder
   ```

- **Using Git**: If your code is hosted on GitHub or GitLab, you can clone the repository directly onto your server.

   Example:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

---

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

1. SSH into your server and navigate to your application directory:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/app
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies using `npm`:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

### Step 4: Configure Your Application for Production

Before running the Node.js API in production, you need to ensure it is optimized and secure.

1. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file or set environment variables (such as API keys, database credentials) for production. Example:

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

   Inside the `.env` file, you can add variables like:

   ```
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE_URL=mongodb://username:password@localhost:27017/your_db
   ```

   Ensure you load these environment variables inside your application using a library like `dotenv`:

   ```bash
   npm install dotenv
   ```

   In your application, load the variables like this:

   ```javascript
   require('dotenv').config();
   ```

2. **Enable Production Mode**: When running the application in production, make sure you're using the correct environment settings. You can set the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to "production":

   ```bash
   export NODE_ENV=production
   ```

3. **Use a process manager (PM2)**: PM2 is a great tool to manage your Node.js application in production. It helps keep the app running even after crashes or server reboots.

   Install PM2 globally:

   ```bash
   sudo npm install -g pm2
   ```

   Start your app with PM2:

   ```bash
   pm2 start app.js --name "my-node-api"
   ```

   To ensure your app restarts after a reboot:

   ```bash
   pm2 startup
   pm2 save
   ```

### Step 5: Configure Nginx as a Reverse Proxy (Optional)

If you're using Nginx to proxy requests to your Node.js API (recommended for production environments), you need to configure Nginx to forward incoming HTTP requests to your Node.js app.

1. **Create a new Nginx configuration file**:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-api
   ```

2. Add the following configuration:

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your_domain_or_ip;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;  # Your Node.js app is running on port 3000
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Enable your Nginx site**:

   Create a symbolic link to enable the configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-api /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   ```

4. **Test Nginx Configuration**:

   Test if the configuration is correct:

   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   ```

5. **Reload Nginx**:

   Reload Nginx to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

---

### Step 6: Open Ports and Firewall Settings

Ensure that your firewall allows traffic on HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) if you plan to serve the app over SSL.

1. Check the firewall status:

   ```bash
   sudo ufw status
   ```

2. Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic:

   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
   sudo ufw enable
   ```

---

### Step 7: (Optional) Set Up SSL with Let's Encrypt

For security, you should serve your Node.js API over HTTPS. You can use **Let's Encrypt** to get a free SSL certificate.

1. Install Certbot (Let’s Encrypt client):

   ```bash
   sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
   ```

2. Obtain and install the SSL certificate for your domain:

   ```bash
   sudo certbot --nginx -d your_domain.com
   ```

3. Test automatic renewal:

   ```bash
   sudo certbot renew --dry-run
   ```

---

### Step 8: Verify and Test

1. **Check the application**: After starting the application with PM2, check the status:

   ```bash
   pm2 status
   ```

2. **Test your Node.js API**: Open a browser and go to `http://your_domain_or_ip` (or `https://` if you've configured SSL). You should see your Node.js API in action.

---

### Summary of Steps

1. Set up your server (Node.js, Nginx, etc.).
2. Transfer your application files to the server.
3. Install dependencies and configure the application for production.
4. Use PM2 to manage the Node.js process.
5. Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy (optional but recommended).
6. Open necessary ports in the firewall.
7. Optionally, set up SSL using Let’s Encrypt for HTTPS.

Now you have successfully deployed your Node.js API to an Ubuntu server, and it's ready to handle production traffic! If you encounter any issues or have more questions, feel free to ask.
